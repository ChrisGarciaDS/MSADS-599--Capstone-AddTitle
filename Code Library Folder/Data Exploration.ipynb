    "Using stacked up histograms, we can compare the distributions of most sent and most received tokens between fraud and non-fraud cases, allowing us to identify whether specific tokens are more prevalent in fraudulent transactions and gaining insights to enhance fraud detection and prevention strategies.\n",

    "Note: In our analysis, we have chosen to filter out the tokens received/sent to be above 50 occurrences. By setting this threshold, we focus on tokens that appear frequently in transactions, allowing us to concentrate on the more prevalent and potentially significant tokens in our investigation of cryptocurrency fraud. This approach helps us gain deeper insights into patterns and trends associated with these commonly transacted tokens, enhancing our ability to detect and address potential fraudulent activities effectively."
