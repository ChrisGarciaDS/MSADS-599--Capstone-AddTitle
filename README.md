## Astract

Cryptocurrency has become a highly popular new method of online transactions in recent years. As with any other type of currency that increases in demand, so does the increase in scam. The goal of this project is to apply data science research techniques to and determine if using a machine learning model that can assist organizations in catching fraudulent transactions efficiently. The data collected was downloaded, balanced and scaled for use building machine learning models, utilizing Python programming. Among the models investigated, which are logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost and SVM (Support Vector Machine), SVM had the best performance of detecting fraud. F-1 score and ROC-AUC curve were used as the measure of performance. More data on cryptocurrencies, especially more recent data on fraudulent activities, will strengthen the model and will further help enhance the security of cryptocurrencies.

## Business Background

The amount of digital scams has increased by 600 percent since 2021 (Grensing-Pophal, 2022). Cryptocurrencies have gained vast popularity with the increased use in online transactions in recent years. However, with online transactions comes online security risks. When using cryptocurrencies for online transactions, it is easy to share one’s personal information to buyers and sellers. Now more than ever, customers as well as businesses are facing higher security risks due to the use of cryptocurrencies for digital transactions

## Problem

Due to increases in security risks for cryptocurrency fraud, it is pivotal to prevent such attacks during online transactions. Since as a society moving onto digital forms of payments, it is imperative that solutions are provided in order to reduce the incidents of transactional fraud.
Currency as well as having the ability to make a purchase is critical to a thriving global economy. Users more so than vendors fall more vulnerable to cryptocurrency fraud. However, today’s access to numerous ways to scam online, has provided a medium for scammers to cause harm towards end users of cryptocurrencies. Whether this means making a purchase, or investing in public stock options. Users are aware of security risks when sharing personal information online from social media, banking, as well as other forms of online transactions. This creates a higher precedent as we move towards a digital society.

## Results

In an effort to reduce cryptocurrency fraud, a variety of machine learning algorithms were utilized to test the hypothesis on whether using such advanced methods could enhance the security of cryptocurrency transactions. This section's primary focus was on the application of logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost, and support vector machines to detect fraudulent transactions. The results demonstrate the significant potential of using such advanced methods in enhancing security measures for cryptocurrencies. Table 6.1 shows the performance metrics for all trained models. Figure 7 shows the ROC curves and AUC values which underscore the model’s ability to distinguish between the fraudulent and regular transactions, even in the case of class imbalance. The findings provide evidence that leveraging advanced machine learning can enhance the security measures for cryptocurrency and protect users from fraudulent activities. The success of a machine learning approach in accurately detecting fraudulent transactions aligns closely with the hypothesis.

## Conclusion

During this project, we have explored the extensive issue of cryptocurrency fraud, which has materialized as a challenge in the evolving world of digital transactions. With the adoption and high usage of cryptocurrencies, so does the number of fraudulent transactions, which in turn cause financial loss in the growth of a digital economy. Furthermore, we have delved into utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning methods to mitigate the increase in cryptocurrency fraud. These machine learning algorithms, including Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost, have shown evidence in detecting fraudulent transactions, in turn offering an effective and efficient approach to safeguarding the usage of digital currencies. Nonetheless, we must be vigilant in researching and developing new measures against fraudulent transactions. With technology playing a critical role in detecting fraud, also raising awareness to the general public on digital transactions and risks regarding cryptocurrencies is crucial. Ultimately, cryptocurrency fraud causes a challenge that demands a proactive approach. Combining the efforts of technological advances, regulations, as well as education could positively impact a more secure, and transparent and trustworthy perspective for cryptocurrencies. As we move towards a balance between security and innovation, we in turn take a formidable approach towards reaching cryptocurrencies full potential as a great and positive force for the global economy.

## Future Remarks

Ultimately, having a larger sample of data could prove to be useful when using advanced machine learning methods. The lack of data in this project has proved to be challenging when building a well performing model. Though this project used powerful methods, more data is gathered, such advanced methods will improve, deming the models to better enhance future security. Although the use of machine learning has demonstrated strong potential in augmenting the security of cryptocurrencies, having human review and interference is recommended along with the use of advanced methods.
